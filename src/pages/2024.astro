            A tiered tuition plan means we ask families to pay at a level that fits their means. This contributes to the ministry of this program, allowing any student to participate regardless of financial ability. We appreciate any families who are able to <a href="https://youth-sing-praise-foundation-inc.square.site/product/unrestricted-donation/1" target="_blank"> contribute</a> more to so to help with this mission. The actual costs of this all-inclusive camp include: lodging, meals, performance and retreat materials, and more. Families are asked to arrange transportation to and from camp, and to send a few costume pieces if they have them. 
            <br/>
            Tuition levels are at $750, $1,000 and $1,500. Sibling discounts are available, and we accept requests for financial assistance.
