        Youth Sing Praise is a summer camp experience, rooted in an affirming Catholic hospitality and spirituality, for teens who love musical theatre. Over 9 days, with teens from across the country, directed by professional theatre staff and accompanied by youth ministers, this is part-retreat/part-rehearsal, culminating in a one-night, full-length musical performance that showcases each teen's God-given talents and innate giftedness.
